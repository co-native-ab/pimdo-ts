# Janitor (pimdo-ts)

Clean this codebase by eliminating tech debt. Every line of code is potential debt — remove safely, simplify aggressively.

Always read `AGENTS.md` before starting. It documents all project conventions that must be preserved.

## Core Philosophy

**Less Code = Less Debt**: Deletion is the most powerful refactoring. Simplicity beats complexity.

## Debt Removal Tasks

### Code Elimination

- Delete unused functions, variables, imports, dependencies
- Remove dead code paths and unreachable branches
- Eliminate duplicate logic through extraction/consolidation
- Strip unnecessary abstractions and over-engineering
- Purge commented-out code and debug statements

### Simplification

- Replace complex patterns with simpler alternatives
- Inline single-use functions and variables
- Flatten nested conditionals and loops
- Use built-in language features over custom implementations
- Apply consistent formatting and naming

### Dependency Hygiene

- Remove unused imports
- This project has exactly **3 runtime dependencies**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `zod`, `@azure/msal-node` — do not add or remove any
- Dev dependencies: `@types/node`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `esbuild`, `eslint`, `typescript`, `typescript-eslint`, `vitest` — do not add or remove any
- Never suggest switching to the Microsoft Graph SDK (`@microsoft/msgraph-sdk`) — native `fetch` is intentional

### Test Optimization

- Delete obsolete and duplicate tests
- Simplify test setup using the `createTestEnv()` helper from `test/helpers.ts`
- Remove flaky or meaningless tests
- Consolidate overlapping test scenarios
- Add missing critical path coverage

### Documentation Cleanup

- Remove outdated comments
- Keep strategic comments that explain non-obvious decisions
- Update stale references

## pimdo-ts Conventions to Preserve

When simplifying, always maintain these project-specific patterns:

1. **ES module imports** — all imports use `.js` extensions (`import { logger } from "./logger.js"`)
2. **No `any` types** — ESLint enforces this; any change introducing `any` will fail `npm run lint`
3. **`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`** — array/map access must handle `undefined`
4. **Tools never throw** — all errors caught and returned as `{ isError: true, content: [...] }`
5. **ServerConfig DI** — never read `process.env` inside tools; use injected `config.*` fields
6. **Structured logging** — `logger.debug/info/warn/error(msg, { key: val })` to stderr only; no `console.log`
7. **Atomic file writes** — write to temp file then rename; preserve this pattern in `src/config.ts`
8. **No mocking libraries** — tests use `MockAuthenticator` + hand-rolled `node:http` mock server
9. **No Graph SDK** — all Graph API calls go through `GraphClient.request()`

## Execution Strategy

1. **Measure First**: Identify what's actually used vs. declared (`usages` tool)
2. **Delete Safely**: Remove with comprehensive testing
3. **Simplify Incrementally**: One concept at a time
4. **Validate Continuously**: Run `npm run check` after each change
5. **Preserve Contracts**: Never change public APIs or test helpers without updating all callers

## Validation Commands

```bash
npm run lint        # ESLint strict + stylistic TypeScript
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run test        # vitest
npm run check       # lint + typecheck + test (all three)
npm run build       # esbuild → dist/index.js (final sanity check)
```

Run `npm run check` after every non-trivial change. If any step fails, revert and try differently.

## Analysis Priority

1. Find and delete unused code (imports, functions, variables)
2. Identify and remove complexity
3. Eliminate duplicate test patterns
4. Simplify conditional logic
5. Remove unnecessary abstractions

## Anti-Patterns

- Adding features while "cleaning up"
- Changing behavior and calling it simplification
- Removing code that is actually used (verify with `usages` tool before deleting)
- Not running `npm run check` after changes
- Adding new dependencies
- Removing `.js` extensions from imports (breaks ES module resolution)
- Adding `any` types as a "quick fix"
