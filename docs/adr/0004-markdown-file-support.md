# ADR-0004: Markdown File Support on OneDrive

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

AI agents frequently need to read and write short-to-medium-length text documents — notes, drafts, outlines, prompt templates, conversation transcripts, research summaries. Storing these in Microsoft Graph alongside the user's mail and tasks keeps agent-produced artefacts in a familiar, backed-up, user-controlled location without introducing a new storage dependency.

Microsoft Graph exposes a file system via OneDrive (`/me/drive`). Extending pimdo-ts with markdown-file tools is a natural next Graph surface to cover, but it introduces new forces that do not apply to mail or To Do:

- **Arbitrary content**: unlike a todo title or mail subject, a markdown document can be of arbitrary length. Microsoft Graph's `/content` endpoint accepts simple `PUT` uploads up to 250 MB ([driveItem: PUT content](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-put-content?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)); even larger files require a **resumable upload session**, which is a multi-request protocol: create a session, stream chunks of up to 60 MiB with precise Content-Range headers, retry partial failures, and finalise the session. Implementing this well requires byte-accurate streaming, chunk-level retry logic, progress reporting, and session teardown on abort. pimdo-ts intentionally caps payloads well below the Graph limit (see "4 MiB Tool-Side Cap" below) — markdown notes do not need either path's headroom.
- **Scope of access**: OneDrive access ranges from `Files.Read` (read-only, all files) down to `Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder` (read/write in a single app-owned folder). The scope choice sets both the capability and the blast radius: an agent with `Files.ReadWrite` can — absent further constraints — reach every file in the user's drive, which is a meaningfully larger blast radius than mail-to-self or a single todo list (see [ADR-0001](./0001-minimize-blast-radius.md)).
- **"Which file?" ambiguity**: for mail and todo items, an ID-based API is enough. For files the agent frequently knows the human-readable name ("open my `ideas.md`") before it knows any ID, so the tool surface must support name-based addressing while keeping IDs as the canonical reference.
- **Consistency with existing design**: pimdo-ts already has a well-worn pattern for "scope agent access to a single container chosen by the human via the browser" — the To Do list picker. Reusing that pattern is strongly preferred to inventing a new one.

## Decision

pimdo-ts adds five MCP tools for markdown file management, scoped to a single OneDrive folder the user selects through the browser.

### 1. Delegated `Files.ReadWrite` Scope

We add `Files.ReadWrite` as a new optional scope. It grants read/write access to the signed-in user's OneDrive (not `Files.ReadWrite.All`, which extends to files shared with the user, and not the narrower `.AppFolder` variant, which requires a registered app folder that the user cannot casually browse into).

The Graph API has no native way to pre-restrict a delegated token to a single folder — that restriction is enforced by pimdo-ts in its tool layer, not by Entra ID. The token itself permits read/write to the whole OneDrive, so the in-process scoping (see decision 2) is the only thing keeping the agent confined.

### 2. Browser-Picked Root Folder, Persisted to Config

On first use the agent calls `markdown_select_root_folder`, which opens a browser picker listing the top-level folders in the user's OneDrive. The user clicks one, and the chosen drive item ID is stored in `markdown.rootFolderId` in `config.json`. All subsequent file tools operate **only** on children of that folder.

This mirrors the existing `todo_select_list` design exactly: the picker runs on a local HTTP server, browser launch is injected via `ServerConfig.openBrowser`, and selection is a human-only action (the agent cannot call a hidden "set root folder" API path). Calling the tool again overwrites the stored folder.

The picker lists a **flat** top-level folder listing rather than supporting recursive navigation. This keeps parity with the todo list picker and avoids building a generalised folder-tree UI. For usability at scale, the generic picker (used by both `markdown_select_root_folder` and `todo_select_list`) provides: a client-side filter/search box; a refresh button that calls `GET /options` on the picker server to re-run the provider; and an optional "Create new …" link that opens the underlying service (OneDrive, Microsoft To Do) in a new tab so users can create a new folder/list without leaving the flow. Refreshing replaces the server's set of valid selections, so a selection can never resolve to a stale option that is no longer offered.

The markdown picker and its subtitle explicitly mention OneDrive — this is the one human-facing surface where naming the storage provider is useful, so the user understands _where_ the folder will live. The agent-facing tool descriptions keep the generic "markdown storage" framing from decision 7.

### 2a. Strict Root-Folder ID Validation on Load

`markdown.rootFolderId` must always be a non-empty opaque drive item ID pointing to a single existing top-level folder. To make this invariant a property of every tool call (not just of the picker's write path), `loadAndValidateMarkdownConfig` re-validates the stored value on every tool invocation and refuses: empty strings, `"/"` or `"\\"` (which could otherwise be misinterpreted as "the drive root"), any value containing `/` or `\\` (which could alias to a subdirectory path), and any value containing whitespace. A configured-but-invalid root folder produces a distinct error from "not configured" (e.g. `"markdown root folder invalid (contains a path separator …)"`) and in both cases the error directs the user back to `markdown_select_root_folder`. This closes the hole where a hand-edited or corrupted `config.json` could silently escalate the tools' reach from one folder to a whole drive or a deep path.

### 3. Flat, Non-Recursive File Listing

`markdown_list_files` returns `.md` files **directly** under the configured folder — not recursively. This:

- Matches the mental model of a dedicated "notes folder" set by the user.
- Keeps the blast radius obvious: the agent can only touch files at exactly one level.
- Avoids unbounded page-through of large drive subtrees.

Filtering is primarily client-side: Graph's `$filter` on drive items does not reliably support the string functions needed to test a file extension. `$top=200` bounds the request; pagination is not exposed because the design is scoped to a user's own notes folder where a single page is expected to cover the common case.

### 4. 4 MiB Tool-Side Cap on Content Transfers

`markdown_get_file`, `markdown_create_file`, `markdown_update_file`, `markdown_get_file_version`, and `markdown_diff_file_versions` use direct `GET` / `PUT` against `/content` and `/versions/{id}/content`. pimdo-ts caps payloads at 4 MiB = 4,194,304 bytes per file.

**This is a pimdo-ts policy limit, not a Microsoft Graph API limit.** Microsoft Graph's `/content` endpoint accepts simple `PUT` uploads up to 250 MB ([driveItem: PUT content](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-put-content?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)); resumable upload sessions extend that further. The cap exists in pimdo-ts to keep the markdown tool surface focused on its intended use case (hand-written notes and small documents), not to satisfy a Graph API constraint.

Concretely:

- `markdown_create_file` and `markdown_update_file` check `Buffer.byteLength(content, "utf-8")` **before** making any network call and return a structured `MarkdownFileTooLargeError` if over 4 MiB.
- `markdown_get_file` and `markdown_get_file_version` read the target's `size` via a metadata request first and refuse to download when it exceeds 4 MiB; they also re-check the received body length as a defence-in-depth measure.

Rationale for the cap:

- **Scope fit**: markdown documents above 4 MiB are extremely rare in practice. The 99th-percentile note, draft, or outline is well under 100 KiB. The cap signals "this tool is for notes" and discourages agents from using it for bulk file storage.
- **Bounded agent payloads**: every byte that flows through these tools also flows through an MCP client/agent context. Capping at 4 MiB keeps a single tool call from blowing up an agent's context budget.
- **Avoided complexity**: not raising the cap means no upload sessions, no chunked streaming with precise Content-Range headers, no chunk-level retries, no progress reporting, no session lifecycle management. Every one of those would add code paths and error conditions.
- **Easy to revisit**: the cap is a single constant (`MAX_DIRECT_CONTENT_BYTES` in `src/graph/markdown.ts`). Raising it later if a concrete need emerges is a one-line change plus updated documentation. Until then, the conservative value is the safer default.

### 5. ID-or-Name Addressing

`markdown_get_file`, `markdown_update_file`, and `markdown_delete_file` accept either a `itemId` (canonical drive item ID) or a `fileName` (case-insensitive match against files in the configured root folder, subject to the naming rules in decision 7). Name-only calls perform a listing and match locally — this keeps the API ergonomic for agents that rarely remember opaque IDs and avoids fragile URL encoding of names with special characters. `markdown_create_file` is keyed by `fileName` only, since Graph's path-style `PUT` (`/items/{parent}:/filename:/content?@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior=fail`) is the natural create-only endpoint.

### 6. Raw-Body Request Path in `GraphClient`

The existing `GraphClient.request` always JSON-encodes the body and sets `Content-Type: application/json`. OneDrive `/content` uploads require a **raw** request body with a non-JSON content type. We add `GraphClient.requestRaw(method, path, body, contentType, signal)` that shares the retry, auth, and timeout logic via a common private `performRequest` helper, and keeps the JSON path unchanged. This is the minimum viable extension to the HTTP client — it does not introduce a streaming API, since upload sessions are not supported.

### 7. Strict, Cross-OS-Safe File Names with UNSUPPORTED Classification on Listing

All tools that accept a markdown file name enforce a conservative allow-list: names must end in `.md` (case-insensitive), contain only letters, digits, space, dot, underscore, and hyphen, start with a letter or digit, be at most 255 characters, must not contain path separators or subdirectory segments, must not be a Windows reserved device name (`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM0`–`COM9`, `LPT0`–`LPT9`), and must not have leading/trailing whitespace or a trailing dot before `.md`. The full rule set lives in `validateMarkdownFileName` and is also exported as a human-readable `MARKDOWN_FILE_NAME_RULES` string embedded verbatim in each tool's description.

Enforcement points:

- **`markdown_create_file` / `markdown_update_file`**: validated at the zod-schema layer so the MCP SDK rejects bad names before the handler runs. The agent receives a structured `Invalid arguments` error whose message reproduces the specific violated rule.
- **`markdown_get_file` / `markdown_delete_file` / `markdown_update_file` / `markdown_list_file_versions` / `markdown_get_file_version` by name**: validated at the zod-schema layer via the shared `idOrNameShape`, so the MCP SDK rejects bad names before the handler runs — and the handler additionally re-validates the resolved item as defence in depth.
- **`markdown_get_file` / `markdown_update_file` / `markdown_delete_file` by itemId**: the resolved drive item is re-validated after fetch. Subdirectories (drive items with a `folder` facet) are rejected with a dedicated "subdirectory is not supported" message; files whose _stored_ name violates the rules — which can happen if a file was created or renamed outside pimdo — are rejected with the specific rule that was violated. This closes the loophole where a valid-looking itemId could bypass the name validation that guards the by-name path.
- **`findMarkdownFileByName`** (internal): re-validates its input argument and only searches among names that pass validation, so a name-based lookup can never silently resolve to a file whose stored name is unsupported.

Rationale for this specific allow-list:

- **Portability first**: the allow-list is the intersection of what works unchanged on Linux, macOS, and Windows. This matters because users sync these files locally, and files that fail to materialise on a Windows machine are worse than files that were never created.
- **No subdirectories**: rejecting path separators (and reserving the folder facet check in the resolver) means the agent _cannot_ introduce a directory structure via the markdown tools — even if the user's underlying storage supports it. The configured root folder is always the exact and only place the agent writes to.
- **No leading dot / underscore / hyphen**: leading `.` produces hidden files on Unix (which agents rarely want but users rarely audit); leading `-` looks like a CLI flag when the file name is piped into a shell; leading `_` is banned on symmetry with the other two.
- **No Windows reserved names**: `CON.md`, `NUL.md`, etc. are legal on Linux but impossible to create/open on Windows. Rejecting them at write time means everything readable by the agent remains readable on every platform.
- **Length limit of 255**: matches the `NAME_MAX` limit on most filesystems (ext4, HFS+, NTFS per-segment).

Listings take a different tack: rather than hide things that fail validation, `markdown_list_files` surfaces them under an `UNSUPPORTED` section with the specific reason (`"subdirectory — only files directly inside the configured root folder are supported"`, `"unsupported file name: ..."`). The reasoning is that the agent needs to know those entries exist — to avoid picking a file name that would collide with an existing-but-inaccessible file, and to answer questions like "what's in the folder?" accurately — but it must not be able to read, write, or delete them. Non-markdown files (e.g. `photo.jpg`) are not markdown-tool concerns and are omitted from the listing entirely.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **POS-001**: Adds a high-value Graph surface (markdown notes in OneDrive) without weakening the "minimize blast radius" principle — the agent can still only touch a single, user-chosen folder.
- **POS-002**: Reuses the existing browser-picker pattern and config persistence model, keeping pimdo-ts conceptually coherent and keeping the user's mental model ("I pick a container, the agent lives in it") intact.
- **POS-003**: The 4 MiB tool-side cap keeps the codebase small. No session management, no chunked streaming, no progress reporting, no resume logic. Fewer code paths means fewer bugs and easier security review. The cap is one constant and can be raised if a concrete need appears.
- **POS-004**: ID-or-name addressing makes the tools ergonomic for agents without compromising correctness: internally operations always resolve to an ID before acting.
- **POS-005**: The raw-body request path in `GraphClient` generalises cleanly to any future non-JSON Graph surface (e.g., images, ICS files) without requiring another rewrite.
- **POS-006**: Strict, cross-OS-safe naming and the subdirectory ban make the blast radius of a compromised or misbehaving agent bounded _at the file-name layer_, not only at the folder layer. An agent cannot create `../../secrets.md`, `../archive/overwrite.md`, or `CON.md`; it also cannot address such a file even if it already exists on disk.
- **POS-007**: Listings expose unsupported entries explicitly rather than hiding them, so agents planning filenames have an accurate view of the folder and humans reading the listing are not surprised by "missing" files.

### Negative

- **NEG-001**: Token scope is broader than the effective capability. `Files.ReadWrite` grants the agent access to the whole OneDrive at the token layer; the folder restriction lives in pimdo-ts code. A future bug, a tool-routing error, or a malicious fork could bypass it. The mitigation is: this codebase is open source, the restriction point is a single small module, and the picker is human-only.
- **NEG-002**: Files larger than 4 MiB cannot be read or written by these tools, even though Microsoft Graph itself accepts much larger files. Users with that use case must use a different tool, or — if there is a real need — raise `MAX_DIRECT_CONTENT_BYTES`. We accept this on the grounds that markdown notes exceeding 4 MiB are well outside the intended use case.
- **NEG-003**: Flat (non-recursive) listing means users who organise notes into nested folders see only one level. They can still re-point the root folder via `markdown_select_root_folder` to a different subtree.
- **NEG-004**: Name-based lookups require a list request, so operating on a file by name costs one extra Graph call compared to operating by ID.
- **NEG-005**: Files created outside pimdo with names that fail the naming rules are visible in listings (under `UNSUPPORTED`) but unreadable and undeletable by the tools. Users who need to manipulate such files must rename them in their storage provider first, or use a different tool. We accept this because the alternative — relaxing the rules — would undo the cross-OS and blast-radius guarantees.

## Alternatives Considered

### Full Upload Session Support

- **ALT-001**: **Description**: Implement Graph's resumable upload session protocol so files of arbitrary size can be uploaded and downloaded.
- **ALT-002**: **Rejection Reason**: Requires significant streaming and chunk-management code (session create, chunked PUT with Content-Range, partial-failure retry, session cancel on abort, session complete). Adds per-chunk error paths that must be tested and maintained. The benefit is real but serves an out-of-scope use case (bulk file transfer); the scoped "markdown notes" use case is already fully served well below the Graph `/content` limit, and the pimdo-ts 4 MiB cap is intentionally conservative even within that.

### `Files.ReadWrite.AppFolder` Instead of `Files.ReadWrite`

- **ALT-003**: **Description**: Use the narrower AppFolder scope, which restricts the token to a `/me/drive/special/approot` folder owned by the app registration.
- **ALT-004**: **Rejection Reason**: AppFolder is tied to the Entra app registration; it cannot live in an arbitrary user-chosen folder, and the folder is not readily browseable from the OneDrive web UI (it sits under `Apps/<app-name>`). The "human picks the folder they want me to work in" UX — a core part of pimdo-ts's design — is not expressible with AppFolder. The delegated `Files.ReadWrite` scope plus in-tool folder pinning preserves that UX at the cost of a broader token scope (see NEG-001).

### Recursive Folder Listing / Search

- **ALT-005**: **Description**: Let `markdown_list_files` recurse into subfolders, or expose a search tool that locates markdown files anywhere under the configured root.
- **ALT-006**: **Rejection Reason**: Recursion reintroduces the "how deep does the blast radius reach?" question that the flat design deliberately closes off. Users who want more than a single level can always pick a higher-level folder as the root, at the cost of also widening the agent's reach.

### Pagination-Aware File Listing

- **ALT-007**: **Description**: Implement `$top` / `@odata.nextLink` paging for `markdown_list_files` so folders with more than ~200 items are fully listable.
- **ALT-008**: **Rejection Reason**: The design scope ("a notes folder") does not produce folders with thousands of markdown files in practice; the extra complexity is not warranted now. If a future use case calls for it, pagination can be added without breaking the tool contract.

### Store Full Paths in Config Instead of IDs

- **ALT-009**: **Description**: Persist the selected folder as a human-readable path (e.g. `/Notes`) rather than a drive item ID.
- **ALT-010**: **Rejection Reason**: Paths are mutable — users rename and move folders in OneDrive — but drive item IDs are stable. Persisting the ID guarantees the configured folder keeps working across renames. We keep the path as a display-only field in config.

### Looser / Platform-Specific File-Name Rules

- **ALT-011**: **Description**: Accept any Unicode name that happens to be valid on the user's own OS, or accept the broader set that OneDrive itself allows, rather than the strict cross-OS-safe allow-list.
- **ALT-012**: **Rejection Reason**: An agent running on Linux would happily create `emoji 😀.md` or `a:b.md`, which then breaks the moment the file is synced to a Windows machine or checked into a git repo on a case-sensitive filesystem. Worse, any relaxed rule has to answer the question "can the agent create a subdirectory via `..` or `/` in the name" — and every relaxed answer opens attack surface. The strict allow-list is small, easy to describe in one sentence, and makes "what can the agent create?" trivially answerable.

### Hiding Unsupported Entries from Listings

- **ALT-013**: **Description**: Have `markdown_list_files` return only supported files and silently drop everything else.
- **ALT-014**: **Rejection Reason**: Silence causes collisions: an agent asked "is `notes.md` available?" would get "yes" even if an unsupported-named `notes.md` already exists at a different casing or with unsafe characters, and the subsequent upload would overwrite it. Surfacing unsupported entries with their reason lets the agent reason about the full folder contents without being able to _act_ on them. The cost is a few extra lines in the listing output.

## Implementation Notes

- **IMP-001**: New scope `Files.ReadWrite` is added to `GraphScope` and `AVAILABLE_SCOPES` with `required: false`, matching the design of `Mail.Send` and `Tasks.ReadWrite`. Tool registration uses the existing `requiredScopes` mechanism so markdown tools are hidden until the user consents to the scope.
- **IMP-002**: Config is extended with an optional `markdown: { rootFolderId, rootFolderName, rootFolderPath }` object. A new `updateConfig` helper performs load-merge-save so writing the markdown config does not clobber the todo config and vice versa. `hasMarkdownConfig` and `loadAndValidateMarkdownConfig` mirror the existing todo helpers.
- **IMP-003**: Graph operations live in `src/graph/markdown.ts` and cover folder listing, file listing with `.md` filter, metadata fetch, content download, conditional create and update, version history, and delete. The 4 MiB tool-side cap is exported as `MAX_DIRECT_CONTENT_BYTES`. Dedicated `MarkdownFileTooLargeError`, `MarkdownFileAlreadyExistsError`, and `MarkdownCTagMismatchError` classes surface size-cap, create-conflict, and update-cTag-mismatch cases without being conflated with network or authorization errors. The conditional update path sends OneDrive's `cTag` (not `eTag`) in `If-Match` because cTag is the content-only entity tag — using eTag would fire spurious 412s on metadata-only events (rename, share, indexing, preview generation).
- **IMP-004**: `GraphClient` gains a `requestRaw` method that sends a raw string / `Uint8Array` body with a caller-specified `Content-Type` and optional extra headers (used for `If-Match`). The retry / auth / timeout loop is extracted into a private `performRequest` helper reused by `request` and `requestRaw`.
- **IMP-005**: Ten MCP tools live in `src/tools/markdown.ts`: `markdown_select_root_folder`, `markdown_list_files`, `markdown_get_file`, `markdown_create_file`, `markdown_update_file`, `markdown_delete_file`, `markdown_list_file_versions`, `markdown_get_file_version`, `markdown_diff_file_versions`, `markdown_preview_file`. The picker tool reuses `startBrowserPicker` from `src/picker.ts`. All tools return a friendly "not configured — use `markdown_select_root_folder`" error when `markdown.rootFolderId` is missing.
- **IMP-006**: Success criteria: (a) all tools are registered and scope-gated, (b) size-limit enforcement is exercised by unit tests on the download, create, and update paths, (c) the picker persists the selection without overwriting unrelated config, (d) the mock Graph server models the `/me/drive/...` endpoints sufficiently for full end-to-end integration tests against an in-process MCP client (including `?@microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior=fail` 409 conflicts on create and `If-Match` 412 cTag mismatches on update), and (e) the strict file-name rules are enforced at every entry point and tested for all rejection classes.
